            <h2><strong>Weight</strong></h2>
            <p>The iphone 11 pro max has a heavy mass of 226g compared to the note 10+ with 196g. This is seen as a clear
                win on note 10+ because portabilty is really important in mobile devices. You might as well as go for the 
                note 10+ if you think portablitity, the lightness is important on a phone.  
            </p>
            <p>Verdict: note 10+</p>

            <h2><strong>Speed</strong></h2>
            <p>The Iphone 11 pro max includes a A13 bionic chipset, known to be the most powerful in the world right now. Comapared
                to this, samsung galaxy note 10+ includes the Qualcomm's snapdragon 855 chipset or the Exynos 9825 processor as a varient. 
                These processors all perform super good, but the Apple's A13 bionic is able to outperform the snapdragon 855 and the exynos 9825
                with much higher speed. The speed for the note 10's processor is already fast but if you are a person that runs
                a lot of heavy apps, you might get a better experience on iphone 11 pro max.  
            </p>
            <p>Verdict: 11 pro max</p>

            <h2><strong>Internal Storage and RAM</strong></h2>
            <p>The Galacy note 10+ includes a tremendous 12GB of RAM with 256GB minimum internal storage. On the other hand, Iphone 11 pro max still
                has 4GB of installed RAM and 64GB of minimum storage. This is a big minus on Iphone 11 pro max as this is a memory spec of a phone 
                that goes over $2000 NZD. Iphone lets you take 4k videos at 60ffs. This video is extremely high quality and takes up a lot of space. 
                This means 64GB will definately be insufficient for the people to use and they will have to upgrade the phones internal storage by paying
                extra hundreds of dollars, or pay again monthly for the Icloud. This is a big plus on note 10+ because note 10+ has sufficient amount
                of storage and RAM; preventing apps rebooting and letting you to store a lot of big files. Note 10+ is also good because it has a SD card
                slot that you can extend up to 1TB, giving you even more space and convinience in storing files. This is a clear win on note 10+.
            </p>
            <p>Verdict: Note 10+</p>

                <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
                <p>Both note 10+ and Iphone 11 pro max has good design. Personally, I think the note 10's front display looks better than iphones front display,
                    but also think that iphones back looks better than note 10's back. This is because note 10 has a amazing screen to body ratio performing almost
                    the bezel less diplay. More diplay on the screen gives you better experience on watching videos or playing games. The back design tends to be better
                    in iphones In my personal opinion. This is because I think the the colour for iphone 11 pro max gives more luxurious feeling. So for the design, it 
                    is really up to the person as everybody has a diffenret taste. 
                </p>
                <p>Verdict: Draw</p>

                <h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2>
                <p>Both Iphone and note takes amazing photos and videos. Iphone has Triple 12MP Ultra Wide, Wide, and Telephoto cameras at rear an amazing front camarea.
                Note has quad camera including 16MP ultra wide, 12MP Wide-angle, 12MP Telephoto, Depth vision with good front camara. Both note 10+ and Iphone 11 pro max
                takes amazing photos and videos but there are slight difference between the 2 phones. Iphone tends to have a wider colour range and therefore is able to
                produce more of an abundant and realisitc photos. But on the otherhand, note tends to quite overhighlight the lights and always tend to produce brighter
                photos. This can be a pro or a con because iphone takes more realistic landscape photos but photos on note 10 sometimes looks better even though it is more 
                artificial because of the highlights.
