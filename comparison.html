            <h2><strong>Weight</strong></h2>
            <p>The iphone 11 pro max has a heavy mass of 226g compared to the note 10+ with 196g. This is seen as a clear
                win on note 10+ because portabilty is really important in mobile devices. If you are a person that doesn't mind
                about the weight of the phone, this won't be a problem.
