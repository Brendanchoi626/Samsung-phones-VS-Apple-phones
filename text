The samsung Galaxy note 10+ and the Iphone 11 pro max are the best flagship smartphones that are available right now
from two companies. The Specifications above shows that both phones are great and awesome with some pros and cons. 
Some reasons why you should buy Galaxy note 10+

- Good display size and quality
The Galaxy note 10+ has a standard samsung note size, but with a tremendous 6.8 inch display. The screen to body ratio is
also amazing and is perfect for video watchig and note taking. The camera hole infront located on the top middle end of
the display is not really disturbing. Plus, it has a high pixel density of 498ppi giving a great experience of viewing. 

- Perfect phone for a Youtuber with great camera
The Galaxy note 10+, or even a standard note 10 allows you to take a 4k video in 60 frame which is insanely high quality 
and smooth. Note 10+ has an SD card slot and this is really convinient for the youtubers to move the filmed video to the 
PC for editing. 

- Sufficient amount of storage and RAM
The Galaxy note 10+ has a minimum storage of 256GB with an incredible 12GB of installed RAM. This is like experiencing 
PC memory in mobile devices. The maximum storage that note 10+ can expand is 1.5TB (512GB internal storage and 1TB max 
SD card. ) You might think this much storage and the RAM might be a bit of an overkill for an mobile device, but this is
one of the thing thats better to have even if you don't use it all. 

- SPEN
The galaxy note 10+ has a special spen which is capable of doing many things such as Air gesture control, Dawing, 
note taking, capture etc. This will be really convientent occassionally because you will all have that time when 
you really need a spen in your phone. 

Some reasons why you should buy Iphone 11 pro max

- Processor
The apples pocessor were always the fastest and long lasting compared to android's snapdragon processor. A13 binonic
chipset attached to this device shows an outstanding speed that overpowers almost all other android devices. 

- Camera
Iphone 11 pro max has triple camera attatched in the back of the display. As its an iphone, there is no dought in the
quality of the photo this phone can take. Apple further enhanced their camera in the new iphone 11 in feature wise 
and in the quality wise. Just like the samsung galaxy note 10+, it is also capable in recording 4k video in 60 ffs. 

- Good RAM control
Iphone 11 pro max has 4 GB of Ram, but it still showed that extreme speed. 11 pro's 4GB RAM showed a simmlar, or 
sometimes a faster speed compared to the note 10 plus. This is pretty impressive you can't help about apps refreshing
after leaving many apps in the background. 

Reasons why you shouldn't buy note 10+

- Too pricy
Note 10+ is cheaper compared to the iphone 11 pro max or eve iphone 11, but still is expensive for many people to 
afford. If you are going for samsung phones, you might consider buying some cheaper models such as galaxy s10, s9, note 9 
or the A seris. 

- Very thin back
Note 10+ has a thin back and this is done to make the phone as thin as possible. But from the thin back, you can feel
some strong vibrations that can be felt as a bit too much. 

Reasons why you shouldn't buy Iphone 11 pro max

- Way too pricy
Iphone 11 pro max is much more expensive than note 10+ which is already expensive, and if you want to more storage you
have to pay multiple hundred dollars more. If you are going for iphones, you might consider getting an Iphone in a 
lower price range such as iphone xs, iphone 11, iphone xr or even iphone 8. 

- Way too heavy 
Iphone 11 pro max mas a mass of 226g. This might not sound heavy but it is really heavy if you use it in daily bases. 
You might feel inconvienience when playing on your phone before bed time. 
 
Have you made your decisions yet? which phone would you consider buying out of these two? The phones in this website 
is the best performing and therefore the most expensive phones in two companies, and therefore might be a bit too 
much for the most people to afford. Just note that there are always cheaper and good performing phones out in both
companies so you might consider buying those if you don't want to spend too much money on mobile phones.
